# bukkit_tutorials
some minecraft bukkit tutorials I created while learning how to program plugins

tutorials are built with gradle

## Build

run <gradlew.bat> on windows or <./gradlew> on linux

gradlew build:
creates the plugins in tutorial1-x/build/libs folder

gradlew eclipse:
creates eclipse configuration
